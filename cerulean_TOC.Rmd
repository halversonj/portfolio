This is an example of a portfolio that someone might assemble to demonstrate the skills they have developed in VIS 2128. I have created this page using RMarkdown. There are fancier tools out there for creating and hosting webpages, and you are welcome to use any of those if you like. The advantage of this approach is that you can create your webpage directly from RStudio.x

# Maps of San Luis Obispo
Here are two maps of San Luis Obispo, California. I might include some text here as well.

## Isochrones
This map shows isochrones based on transit travel times to the nearest school. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time

## Accessibility
This map shows accessibility based on a distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Displaying raster data on a map
